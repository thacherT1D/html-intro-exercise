    <h3>Top 3 cities I've called home</h3>

        San Fransisco

      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      I visited Seattle in May, it was super beautiful, and got tricked into living there. I lived in Chicago after returning to the US from living in Bali for a half-year. I moved to San Franscisco because I felt the pull of Silicon Valley.

      I have some good friends who live in Switzerland and I hope they show me around Zürich. On the way to Zürich, I'd like to spend a week exploring London and its history. And after Zürich, I'd love to stuff my face with amazing food from Istanbul.
